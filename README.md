# Restaurant Reviews App (Stage 1)
---

## Project Description: Stage 1

We converted a static webpage provided to us, to a mobile-ready web application. Added accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. We also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

This project is created as part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree.

## Run the application

To run the application locally,
1. Download as .zip file  or clone this project:
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/xorindy/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git
    ```
2. We will need to start an HTTP server to make our website run locally. Make sure you have python on your computer. Go into the command line and type:
    ```
    python --version
    ```
    It should give you a version number for what python you have. If you don't have it, download it [here](https://www.python.org/).
3. Once you have Python, change your directory to the cloned project and type:

    For Python 2.x:

    `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

    For Python 3.x:

    `python3 -m http.server 8000`

4. With your server running, visit the site on your browser:

    `http://localhost:8000`
